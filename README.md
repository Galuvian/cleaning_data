This repo contains the course assignment for the Coursera "Getting and Cleaning Data" course.

The raw data came from:

* http://archive.ics.uci.edu/ml/datasets/Human+Activity+Recognition+Using+Smartphones 
* https://d396qusza40orc.cloudfront.net/getdata%2Fprojectfiles%2FUCI%20HAR%20Dataset.zip 


Run the script run_analysis.R to perform the assigned manipulations on the data.

To run the script:
* The script assumes the raw data is in the same directory as the script.  The raw data is already in this repo.
* The install.packages("reshape2") line is commented out.  If you don't have that package already installed, you should uncomment this line or just run it manually.  Keeping this line uncommented makes working in R Studio annoying.
* Just run the script

See my [codebook](codebook.md).
